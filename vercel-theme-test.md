A domain is a user-friendly way of referring to the address [hello](www.baidu.com) access a website on the internet. For example, the domain you're reading this on is `vercel.com`. Domains can be analogous to the address where your house is. When someone sends a letter to your house, they don't need to know exactly *where* it is, they just need the address and the relevant post office handles routing the letter.

The **system** that *manages* the details about where a site is <del>located</del> on the internet, is known as DNS or the ==Domain Name System==. At its most basic, DNS maps <u>human-readable</u> domain names to computer-friendly IP ***addresses***. When you request a site in your browser, the first step[^1] is converting[^2] the domain address to an IP address. That process is handled by DNS and called DNS Resolution. Understanding how DNS works is important to ensure that you are configuring your domain correctly.
